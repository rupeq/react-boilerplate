Feature based modules.

A feature could have the following structure:

src/features/awesome-feature
|
+-- api         # exported API request declarations and api hooks related to a specific feature
|
+-- assets      # assets folder can contain all the static files for a specific feature
|
+-- components  # components scoped to a specific feature
|
+-- hooks       # hooks scoped to a specific feature
|
+-- stores      # state stores for a specific feature
|
+-- types       # typescript types used within the feature
|
+-- utils       # utility functions for a specific feature

NOTE: You don't need all of these folders for every feature. Only include the ones that are necessary for the feature.

In some cases it might be more practical to keep all API calls outside of the features folders in a dedicated api folder where all API calls are defined. This can be useful if you have a lot of shared API calls between features.

In the past, it was recommended to use barrel files to export all the files from a feature. However, it can cause issues for Vite to do tree shaking and can lead to performance issues. Therefore, it is recommended to import the files directly.

It might not be a good idea to import across the features. Instead, compose different features at the application level. This way, you can ensure that each feature is independent which makes the codebase less convoluted.
